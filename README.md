# react-socket-chat-demo

The two packages are based on this tutorial: [How to Build a Real-time Chat Forum using Strapi, Socket.io, React and MongoDB](https://strapi.io/blog/how-to-build-a-real-time-chat-forum-using-strapi-socket-io-react-and-mongo-db) 



## Client 

The basic codes in react-chat-client come from https://github.com/strapi-blog/strapi-blog-ui-starter.
